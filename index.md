## Welcome 

My name is Shi Zhongyu. 
I am an IBI1 student at ZJU-UoE institute, Zhejiang University.
I am a fan of a game anchor called kuangmoge. As his fans, I am willing to be called good homie.
I like playing badminton and watching badminton games. Lee Chong Wei is my favourite player. I admire his spirit that never give up.
